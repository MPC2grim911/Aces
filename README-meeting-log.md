didn't see you after your discussion, so i went to my discussion class
i'm assuming this is the current to do list:
* set up the git repo files
* start filling in what shells we can (review if needed)
* remember to comment what was done in the code and the commit

that'a all i can think of, text me if you see this

Hey so I don't really know how to use git that well. Can you set up the git repo?

Done setting up git files for cpp shells. Sorry for the delay.
Current todo list:
* start filling in what portions of the shells we can (review if needed) by minimal AI deadline
* remember to comment on what was done to the code and commit/update the git repo
