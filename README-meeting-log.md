didn't see you after your discussion, so i went to my discussion class
i'm assuming this is the current to do list:
* set up the git repo files
* start filling in what shells we can (review if needed)
* remember to comment what was done in the code and the commit

that'a all i can think of, text me if you see this

Hey so I don't really know how to use git that well. Can you set up the git repo?
-A

//10.14.18
Done setting up git files for cpp shells. Sorry for the delay.
Current todo list:
* start filling in what portions of the shells we can (review if needed) by minimal AI deadline
* remember to comment on what was done to the code and commit/update the git repo

Ok! The minimal AI is due on 11/4/18. I'll definitely start working on Monday since I'll have time. Do you have an openlabs environment running?
-A

//10.14.18
Not at the moment, working on other group projects materials for their designated meeting times. I will see what I can do after I get back from the meetings. Can you update me about what you did when you commit to the repo? That way I can go over and work on what I can in the evening.

I've had no internet or power for the whole day unfortunately... The santa ana winds had my whole neighborhood in a blackout. I'll see what I can do for now.
-A
Update: I've read the entire document thoroughly now. I'm going to try to solve the problem with pseudo code on a piece of paper for now. For the minimal AI, the file by default passes this test. We just need to have it compile on openlabs to get past this check because the average default score is 0 which is higher than -10.
